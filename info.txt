Welcome to the listOfMyCourses!

This repository ( https://github.com/DerErde/listOfMyCourses/wiki ) 
contains information about the courses I have taken.
(A course in Git, Python, and more.)

Also, lectures and notes from the courses themselves are saved in the "Wiki".

The folders (inside this repository) contain a copy of the lectures and materials.
The outlines were created in .html format.
